Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number 
(floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.

Example:
Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].

The input is: vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries ,
 where equations.size() == values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return vector<double>.

According to the example above:

equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
 

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
